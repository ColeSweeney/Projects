We want to create a platform dedicated to reducing food waste and promoting food sustainability. We're on a mission to connect individuals and businesses with surplus food to those in need. Join us in our effort to combat the alarming 35% of annual food waste in the national supply chain. Together, we can make a meaningful impact and build a more sustainable future.

### Tips for Food Sustainability

- Plan your meals
- Understand your expiration dates
- Freeze excess food for future enjoyment
- Donate to local food banks or charities

Thank you for taking a look at our project! :smile:
